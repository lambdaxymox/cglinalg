# Computer Graphics Linear Algebra Library
The `cglinalg` library is a low-dimensional linear algebra library aimed at
real-time computer graphics. The purpose of this library is to provide a strongly typed
system that provides all the linear algebra machinery typically used in 
real-time computer graphics applications.
